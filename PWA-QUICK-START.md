## 📋 Next Steps

### 1. Add App Icons (Optional but Recommended)

Your app currently uses placeholder icons. To add custom icons:

**Easy Way:**
1. Visit https://realfavicongenerator.net/
2. Upload your logo (512x512px PNG)
3. Generate icons
4. Download and extract to `public/icons/`

**Manual Way:**
Create these sizes and save to `public/icons/`:
- icon-72x72.png
- icon-96x96.png
- icon-128x128.png
- icon-144x144.png
- icon-152x152.png
- icon-192x192.png
- icon-384x384.png
- icon-512x512.png

### 2. Customize App Info

Edit `public/manifest.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "Your App Name Here",
  "short_name": "Short Name",
  "description": "Your description",
  "theme_color": "#000000",
  "background_color": "#ffffff"
}
```

### 3. Deploy to Production

**Vercel (Recommended):**
```powershell
# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

**Other Platforms:**
- Ensure HTTPS is enabled (required for PWA)
- Deploy `public/` folder contents
- Service worker will auto-register

### 4. Test Offline Features

Users can now:
- ✅ View cached meal plans offline
- ✅ Browse saved recipes offline
- ✅ See shopping lists offline
- ✅ View meal templates offline

When back online:
- ✅ Automatic sync (future feature)
- ✅ Data refresh
- ✅ New content loads

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Service Worker Not Working
**Problem:** No service worker in DevTools
**Solution:**
1. Make sure you ran `npm run build` (development mode doesn't register SW)
2. Visit on HTTPS or localhost
3. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

### Install Prompt Not Showing
**Problem:** No install button appears
**Solution:**
1. Wait 30 seconds after page load
2. Check if already installed (Settings → Apps)
3. Try in Chrome/Edge (best PWA support)
4. Must be on HTTPS in production

### Offline Mode Not Working
**Problem:** App doesn't work offline
**Solution:**
1. Visit pages first while online (builds cache)
2. Check DevTools → Application → Cache Storage
3. Verify service worker is "activated"
4. Try hard refresh and go offline again
