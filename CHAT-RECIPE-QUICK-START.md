      to move on to the instructions? (Say 'yes' or add more)

👤 You: yes

🤖 AI: Excellent! Now, let's talk about how to prepare Chocolate chip 
      cookies. Walk me through the cooking steps.

👤 You: Mix dry ingredients. Cream butter and sugar. Add eggs and 
      vanilla. Combine wet and dry. Fold in chocolate chips. Bake 
      at 350F for 12 minutes.

🤖 AI: Got it! I've added the steps. Looks like we have a good flow! 
      Want to add any final details like prep time, servings, or 
      cuisine type?

👤 You: Makes 24 cookies, takes 30 minutes, American, easy
