## üöÄ What to Do Right Now

### Before Committing Code:

1. **Verify no secrets in Git:**
   ```powershell
   git diff --cached | Select-String "sk-"
   # Should return nothing
   ```

2. **Add the new security files:**
   ```powershell
   git add src/lib/rate-limit.ts
   git add src/app/api/user/data-export/
   git add src/app/api/cooking-assistant/route.ts
   git add OPENAI-SECURITY-GUIDE.md
   git add PRIVACY-COMPLIANCE-GUIDE.md
   git add SECURITY-COMMIT-CHECKLIST.md
   ```

3. **Commit with descriptive message:**
   ```powershell
   git commit -m "feat: Add security and privacy compliance features

   - Implement rate limiting (20 req/min) to protect API key
   - Add data export endpoint for CCPA/GDPR compliance
   - Create security and privacy documentation
   - Verify API keys not exposed in Git history"
   ```

### After Committing:

1. **Set OpenAI spending limits** (IMPORTANT!)
   - https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits
   - Hard limit: $10/month
   - Soft limit: $5/month

2. **Create legal pages** (before public launch):
   - Privacy Policy
   - Terms of Service

3. **Test the data export:**
   - Log in as a user
   - Visit `/api/user/data-export`
   - Verify JSON downloads correctly
