# ✅ Advanced Security Features - Activation Checklist

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

All five requested security features have been successfully implemented:

1. ✅ **Password History Tracking** - Prevents password reuse
2. ✅ **Enhanced Security Headers** - CSP, HSTS, and comprehensive protection  
3. ✅ **Login Anomaly Detection** - AI-powered suspicious login detection
4. ✅ **WebAuthn Support** - Passwordless biometric authentication
5. ✅ **Security Event Webhooks** - Real-time security notifications

---

## 🚨 REQUIRED STEPS TO ACTIVATE

### Step 1: Run Database Migration ⚠️ REQUIRED

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add-security-features
```

This creates 5 new database tables:
- `PasswordHistory`
- `LoginAttempt`
- `WebAuthnCredential`
- `WebAuthnChallenge`
- `SecurityEvent`

### Step 2: Regenerate Prisma Client ⚠️ REQUIRED

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

This updates the Prisma client to include the new models.

### Step 3: Restart Your Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## ✅ Features Already Active

These features work immediately after migration (no additional setup needed):

### 1. Password History ✅
- **Auto-integrated** in `/api/user/password` (password changes)
- **Auto-integrated** in `/api/register` (new users)
- Prevents users from reusing their last 5 passwords
- No configuration needed!

### 2. Security Headers ✅
- **Active on all routes** via `next.config.ts`
- HSTS enforces HTTPS in production
- CSP prevents XSS attacks
- No configuration needed!

### 3. Login Anomaly Detection ✅
- **Auto-integrated** in `/lib/auth.ts` (login flow)
- Blocks logins after 5 failed attempts
- Detects suspicious IP/device changes
- Automatically sends security alerts
- No configuration needed!

---

## 🔧 Optional Configuration

### WebAuthn (Optional - User Opt-in)

Users can enable passwordless authentication through API endpoints:

```typescript
// Frontend implementation needed (optional)
// GET /api/auth/webauthn/register - Get registration options
// POST /api/auth/webauthn/register - Register device
```

### Security Webhooks (Optional - For Monitoring)

Set up webhook endpoints to receive real-time security alerts:

```bash
# Create webhook (SUPER_ADMIN only)
POST /api/security/webhooks
{
  "name": "Slack Alerts",
  "url": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL",
  "events": ["login_anomaly", "password_changed", "account_locked"]
}
```

---

## 🧪 Test the Features

### Test 1: Password History
```bash
# Change password successfully
1. Login to your account
2. Go to Settings → Change Password
3. Change password to "NewPassword123!@#"

# Try to reuse the same password (should fail)
4. Change password again to "NewPassword123!@#"
5. Should see: "Password was used recently. Please choose a different password."
```

### Test 2: Security Headers
```bash
# Check headers in browser
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Refresh page
4. Click on any request
5. Look at Response Headers
6. Should see: Strict-Transport-Security, Content-Security-Policy, etc.
```

### Test 3: Login Anomaly Detection
```bash
# Trigger account lockout
1. Try to login with wrong password 5 times
2. 6th attempt should be blocked
3. Should see: "Account temporarily locked due to too many failed login attempts"

# Check login attempts log
4. Login as admin
5. Check database: SELECT * FROM "LoginAttempt" ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC
```

### Test 4: WebAuthn (Optional - Requires compatible device)
```bash
# Check if device supports WebAuthn
1. Open browser console
2. Run: console.log(window.PublicKeyCredential)
3. If defined, device supports WebAuthn

# Test registration endpoint
4. GET /api/auth/webauthn/register
5. Should return challenge and options
```

### Test 5: Security Events
```bash
# View your security events
GET /api/security/events

# View all events (admin only)
GET /api/security/events?limit=100
```

## 📊 Monitoring Dashboard

### View Login Attempts (SQL)
```sql
-- Recent failed logins
SELECT * FROM "LoginAttempt"
WHERE successful = false
  AND "createdAt" > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC;

-- Accounts with most failed attempts
SELECT email, COUNT(*) as failures
FROM "LoginAttempt"
WHERE successful = false
  AND "createdAt" > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
GROUP BY email
ORDER BY failures DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### View Security Events (SQL)
```sql
-- Recent security events
SELECT * FROM "SecurityEvent"
WHERE "createdAt" > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC;

-- High severity events
SELECT * FROM "SecurityEvent"
WHERE severity IN ('high', 'critical')
  AND "createdAt" > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC;
```
