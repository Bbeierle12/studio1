## 🎯 Next Session Tasks

### Immediate (5-20 minutes)
1. **Check Vercel deployment status**
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Verify build succeeded

2. **Run database migration** ⚠️ CRITICAL
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Prisma CLI
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   
   # Option 2: Manual SQL
   # Copy from: prisma/migrations/manual_add_favorite_recipes.sql
   # Execute in Vercel Postgres dashboard
   ```

3. **Test Feature #1**
   - API endpoint testing (browser console)
   - UI functionality testing (Recipe Hub)
   - Verify persistence

4. **Mark Feature #1 Complete**
   - Update progress in PHASE-3-SUMMARY.md
   - Update visual roadmap
   - Create completion summary

### Next Feature (4-5 hours)
5. **Start Feature #2: Recipe Export (PDF)**
   - Review plan in RECIPE-HUB-PHASE-3-PLAN.md
   - Create PDF generator utility
   - Implement export button
   - Test downloads

---

## 📚 Key Decisions Made

### Architecture
1. **Separate FavoriteRecipe table**
   - More flexible than boolean on Recipe
   - Allows timestamps, analytics
   - Better for future features

2. **Toggle API endpoint**
   - Single endpoint for add/remove
   - Simpler frontend logic
   - Returns current state

3. **Cascade deletes**
   - Automatic cleanup
   - Data integrity maintained

### Documentation Strategy
1. **Multiple focused docs** vs one huge file
   - Easier to navigate
   - Specific use cases
   - Quick reference

2. **Visual roadmap** included
   - Progress tracking
   - Timeline visibility
   - Motivation boost
