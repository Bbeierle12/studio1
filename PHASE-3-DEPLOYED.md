## 🚀 Vercel Auto-Deployment

Your code is now being automatically deployed by Vercel:

1. ✅ **Detected push** to main branch
2. 🔄 **Building** (should complete in ~2-3 minutes)
3. ⏳ **Deploying** to production
4. ⏳ **Ready** at your Vercel URL

**Check Status**: https://vercel.com/dashboard

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL NEXT STEP

### Database Migration Required!

The code is deployed, but your production database needs the new `FavoriteRecipe` table.

**YOU MUST RUN THIS MIGRATION:**

#### Option 1: Prisma CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Make sure DATABASE_URL is set in Vercel environment variables
# Then run:
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

#### Option 2: Manual SQL in Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to: Vercel Dashboard → Storage → Postgres
2. Click "Query" tab
3. Copy SQL from: `prisma/migrations/manual_add_favorite_recipes.sql`
4. Execute the SQL in the query editor

**The SQL to run:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE "FavoriteRecipe" (
    "id" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "userId" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "recipeId" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "createdAt" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    CONSTRAINT "FavoriteRecipe_pkey" PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "FavoriteRecipe_userId_recipeId_key" 
  ON "FavoriteRecipe"("userId", "recipeId");

CREATE INDEX "FavoriteRecipe_userId_idx" ON "FavoriteRecipe"("userId");
CREATE INDEX "FavoriteRecipe_recipeId_idx" ON "FavoriteRecipe"("recipeId");

ALTER TABLE "FavoriteRecipe" 
  ADD CONSTRAINT "FavoriteRecipe_userId_fkey" 
  FOREIGN KEY ("userId") REFERENCES "User"("id") 
  ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE;

ALTER TABLE "FavoriteRecipe" 
  ADD CONSTRAINT "FavoriteRecipe_recipeId_fkey" 
  FOREIGN KEY ("recipeId") REFERENCES "Recipe"("id") 
  ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE;
```

## 🧪 Testing After Migration

### Quick API Test (Browser Console)

Once migration is run, test on your deployed app:

```javascript
// 1. Get favorites (should return empty array)
await fetch('/api/recipes/favorites').then(r => r.json())

// 2. Add a favorite (replace RECIPE_ID with real ID)
await fetch('/api/recipes/RECIPE_ID/favorite', { 
  method: 'POST' 
}).then(r => r.json())

// 3. Get favorites again (should show the recipe)
await fetch('/api/recipes/favorites').then(r => r.json())
```

### Quick UI Test

1. Go to `/recipe-hub` on your deployed app
2. Click any recipe → Drawer opens
3. Click the heart icon ❤️
4. Check "My Recipes" tab → Should show in Favorites
5. Refresh page → Favorites should persist
