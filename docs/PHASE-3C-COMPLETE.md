      + Meal Type Preference (0-10)
Total: 0-100 points
```

- Memoized with useMemo in React
- Only recalculates when recipes or weather changes
- Minimal re-renders

### Accessibility:
- Keyboard navigable
- Screen reader friendly
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Color-blind safe icons

## 💡 Usage Tips

### For Users:
1. **Add Tags to Recipes:** The more descriptive tags (e.g., "soup", "cold", "comfort", "summer"), the better the suggestions
2. **Check Daily:** Suggestions change with weather, check each day for new ideas
3. **Quick Planning:** Use suggestions to quickly fill your meal plan without browsing entire recipe collection
4. **Seasonal Eating:** Algorithm encourages eating seasonal ingredients naturally

### For Developers:
1. **Extend Matching:** Add more weather conditions in `CONDITION_PREFERENCES`
2. **Adjust Scoring:** Modify score weights in `calculateXScore()` functions
3. **Add Categories:** Extend `SEASONAL_INGREDIENTS` with more produce
4. **Customize UI:** Modify suggestion card layout in `SuggestionCard` component
