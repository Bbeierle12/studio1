2. ⚠️ **Phase 3B needs actual implementation** - Shopping list, templates, and drag & drop were described but not created

### Next Steps:
**Option 1:** Continue using Phase 3A features (fully functional)
- Add/edit/delete meals
- Use recipe selector
- Manage meal plans

**Option 2:** Actually implement Phase 3B features
- Create shopping list dialog and generation logic
- Create meal template system
- Implement drag & drop with @dnd-kit

**Option 3:** Move to Phase 4
- Weather-based suggestions
- Auto-generate meal plans
- Export to PDF

---

## Test Environment
- **OS:** Windows
- **Browser:** Development (localhost)
- **Node Version:** (from package.json)
- **Next.js:** 15.5.4
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Neon)

## Test Conclusion

**Phase 3A: 10/10 features working ✅**

**Phase 3B: 0/3 features implemented ⚠️**

The meal planning calendar is fully functional for **manual meal planning with recipes**. The advanced features (shopping lists, templates, drag & drop) need to be actually created.

**Recommendation:** Implement Phase 3B features if needed, or proceed with current functionality which is already very capable.
