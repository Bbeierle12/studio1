# Authentication-Protected Application

## Overview
The application is now fully protected behind authentication. All content and features require users to log in before accessing any part of the website.

## Changes Made

### 1. Middleware Updates (`src/middleware.ts`)

**Before:**
- Only specific routes were protected
- Home page (`/`) and browse (`/recipes`) were public
- Collections, saved recipes, and recipe editing were protected

**After:**
- **ALL routes except `/login` and `/register` require authentication**
- Users must sign in to access any content
- Unauthenticated users are automatically redirected to `/login`

```typescript
// Only these routes are public (accessible without login)
const PUBLIC_ROUTES = ['/login', '/register'];

// All other routes require authentication
return !!token;
```

### 2. Header Navigation (`src/components/header.tsx`)

**Before:**
- Home and Browse links were always visible
- Collections, Saved, and Add Recipe only showed when logged in

**After:**
- **NO navigation links visible when logged out**
- **ALL navigation tabs appear only after login:**
  - Home
  - Browse
  - Collections
  - Saved
  - Add Recipe

```typescript
// All navigation links - only show when user is authenticated
const navLinks = user ? [
  { href: '/', label: 'Home', icon: Home },
  { href: '/recipes', label: 'Browse', icon: CookingPot },
  { href: '/collections', label: 'Collections', icon: Library },
  { href: '/saved', label: 'Saved', icon: Bookmark },
  { href: '/recipes/new', label: 'Add Recipe', icon: PlusCircle },
] : [];
```

### 3. Home Page (`src/app/page.tsx`)

**Before:**
- Showed landing page with cobblestone arch for non-authenticated users
- Had "Start Preserving Recipes" and "Sign In" buttons

**After:**
- **Redirects to `/login` if user is not authenticated**
- Only displays the dashboard when user is logged in
- Shows loading state during authentication check

```typescript
// Redirect to login if not authenticated
useEffect(() => {
  if (!loading && !user) {
    router.push('/login');
  }
}, [user, loading, router]);
```

### 4. Register Page (`src/app/register/page.tsx`)

**Added:**
- Authentication check to prevent already-logged-in users from accessing
- Redirects authenticated users to home page
- Shows loading spinner during check

```typescript
// Redirect authenticated users to home
useEffect(() => {
  if (!loading && user) {
    router.push('/');
  }
}, [user, loading, router]);
```

### 5. Login Page (`src/app/login/page.tsx`)

**Already Had:**
- Authentication check and redirect (no changes needed)
- Already redirects authenticated users to home page

## User Experience Flow

### For Unauthenticated Users:

1. **Visit any URL** (e.g., `/`, `/recipes`, `/collections`, etc.)
2. **Automatically redirected to `/login`**
3. Must sign in or create account
4. After login, redirected to home page

### For Authenticated Users:

1. **Access any page freely**
2. **See full navigation menu:**
   - Home
   - Browse (Recipes)
   - Collections
   - Saved
   - Add Recipe
3. **All features available:**
   - Voice Assistant
   - Weather-based recommendations
   - Recipe management
   - Shopping lists
   - Unit conversions

### For Login/Register Pages:

1. **Already logged in?** → Automatically redirected to home
2. **Not logged in?** → Can access login/register forms
3. **After successful login/register** → Redirected to home

## Protected Routes

### Public Routes (No Login Required):
- `/login` - Sign in page
- `/register` - Create account page

### Protected Routes (Login Required):
- `/` - Home dashboard
- `/recipes` - Browse recipes
- `/recipes/[id]` - View recipe details
- `/recipes/new` - Create new recipe
- `/recipes/[id]/edit` - Edit recipe
- `/collections` - Recipe collections
- `/saved` - Saved/favorited recipes
- All other routes

## Navigation Behavior

### Before Login:
- Header shows only:
  - Logo
  - Shopping list icon (disabled/hidden)
  - Theme toggle
  - Unit toggle
  - "Sign In" button
- **No navigation tabs visible**

### After Login:
- Header shows:
  - Logo
  - **All navigation tabs** (Home, Browse, Collections, Saved, Add Recipe)
  - Shopping list (functional)
  - Theme toggle
  - Unit toggle
  - User avatar with dropdown menu

## Security Features

### Middleware Protection:
- Server-side route protection
- Prevents unauthorized access
- Automatic redirect to login

### Client-Side Guards:
- React component checks
- Loading states
- Graceful redirects

### Session Management:
- NextAuth.js session handling
- Secure token verification
- Automatic session refresh

## Testing the Changes

### Test 1: Unauthenticated Access
1. Log out if currently logged in
2. Try accessing `/` → Should redirect to `/login`
3. Try accessing `/recipes` → Should redirect to `/login`
4. Try accessing `/collections` → Should redirect to `/login`

### Test 2: Navigation Visibility
1. Visit `/login` → No navigation tabs visible
2. Sign in → Navigation tabs appear
3. Log out → Navigation tabs disappear

### Test 3: Authenticated Redirects
1. Log in successfully
2. Try accessing `/login` → Should redirect to `/`
3. Try accessing `/register` → Should redirect to `/`

### Test 4: Direct URL Access
1. Log out
2. Paste direct URL like `/recipes/some-recipe-id` in browser
3. Should redirect to `/login`
4. After login, may redirect to home (not back to original URL)

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements:
1. **Remember Redirect URL**: After login, redirect to originally requested page
2. **Guest Preview**: Show limited preview content before requiring login
3. **Social Login**: Add Google/Facebook authentication
4. **Email Verification**: Require email confirmation before full access
5. **Role-Based Access**: Different permissions for admins, contributors, viewers

## Benefits of This Approach

### Security:
✅ All sensitive data protected
✅ No unauthorized access
✅ Centralized authentication control

### User Experience:
✅ Clear login requirement
✅ Fast redirects
✅ No broken links for logged-in users
✅ Clean navigation (no clutter when logged out)

### Maintainability:
✅ Simple middleware configuration
✅ Single source of truth for auth
✅ Easy to add new protected routes

## Configuration Files

### Key Files Modified:
1. `src/middleware.ts` - Route protection
2. `src/components/header.tsx` - Navigation visibility
3. `src/app/page.tsx` - Home page redirect
4. `src/app/register/page.tsx` - Register page protection

### Environment Variables Required:
```env
# NextAuth Configuration
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:9002
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secret_here
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Redirect Loop
**Cause**: Home page redirects to login, but login redirects back to home
**Solution**: Check that login page properly detects authentication state

### Issue: Navigation Doesn't Appear After Login
**Cause**: Auth context not updating properly
**Solution**: Verify `useAuth()` hook is working and session is being set

### Issue: Can Access Routes Without Login
**Cause**: Middleware not catching the route
**Solution**: Check `middleware.ts` matcher config and PUBLIC_ROUTES array

### Issue: Session Lost on Refresh
**Cause**: NextAuth session configuration
**Solution**: Verify `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is set and session strategy is correct

## Summary

The application now requires authentication for all content access:
- ✅ Login and register pages are public
- ✅ All other pages require authentication
- ✅ Navigation tabs only visible after login
- ✅ Automatic redirects for unauthenticated users
- ✅ Smooth user experience with loading states

**Users must sign in to see any content beyond the login screen.**
