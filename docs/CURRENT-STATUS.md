### Meal Planning Calendar Implementation

#### Phase 1: Database & API (‚úÖ Complete)
- **Database Schema** - Added 5 new models to Prisma:
  - `MealPlan` - Container for meal plans with date range
  - `PlannedMeal` - Individual meals with recipe/custom meal support
  - `ShoppingList` - Auto-generated shopping lists (structure ready)
  - `MealTemplate` - Reusable meal templates (structure ready)
  - `WeatherCache` - Cached weather forecasts
  - `MealType` enum - BREAKFAST, LUNCH, DINNER, SNACK

- **API Routes** (`src/app/api/`)
  - `/meal-plans` - GET (list), POST (create)
  - `/meal-plans/[id]` - GET (single), PUT (update), DELETE (delete)
  - `/meal-plans/[id]/meals` - POST (add meal), PUT (update meal), DELETE (delete meal)
  - `/weather/forecast` - GET (fetch weather forecast)

- **Services**

  - `use-weather.ts` - Weather forecast fetching with caching

- **Calendar Components** (`src/components/calendar/`)
  - `month-view.tsx` - Monthly calendar grid (6x7 layout)
  - `week-view.tsx` - Weekly meal planning grid (7 days √ó 4 meal types)
  - `day-view.tsx` - Detailed single-day view with weather
  - `day-cell.tsx` - Reusable day cell component
  - `add-meal-dialog.tsx` - Add/edit meal modal
  - `create-meal-plan-dialog.tsx` - Create new meal plan modal
  - `generate-meal-plan-dialog.tsx` - AI meal plan generation (stub)

- **Main Component**
  - `meal-planning-calendar.tsx` - Main calendar interface with view switching

- **Page**
  - `/meal-plan` route - Accessible from header navigation

- **Infrastructure**
  - Installed `@tanstack/react-query` for data fetching
  - Created `query-provider.tsx` for React Query setup
  - Added QueryProvider to app layout

## üöß Known Issues

### TypeScript Language Server
Some TypeScript errors are showing in VS Code due to language server caching:
- Prisma Client type errors (models not recognized)
- Calendar component import errors

**Resolution:**
These are false positives. The dev server and build both work correctly. To clear:
1. Reload VS Code window: `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Developer: Reload Window"
2. Restart TypeScript server: `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "TypeScript: Restart TS Server"

The application is fully functional despite these IDE warnings.

## üìù Files Still Exist (Unused)
These files from the old Forecast-to-Feast feature are still in the codebase but not used:
- `src/components/forecast-to-feast-hero.tsx`
- `src/lib/meal-recommendations.ts`
- `scripts/test-weather-recommendations.ts`

**Action Required:** These can be safely deleted if desired for complete cleanup.

## üéØ Next Steps

### Optional: Complete Cleanup
Delete unused Forecast-to-Feast files:
```bash
Remove-Item src/components/forecast-to-feast-hero.tsx
Remove-Item src/lib/meal-recommendations.ts
Remove-Item scripts/test-weather-recommendations.ts
```
