# Forecast-to-Feast Feature Removal Summary

## ✅ Completed Removal

The Forecast-to-Feast feature has been successfully removed from the codebase and replaced with the new Meal Planning Calendar system.

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. Recipes Page (`/recipes`)
**Before:**
- Had tabs: "Weather-Smart Picks" and "All Recipes"
- Featured the `<ForecastToFeastHero>` component in the weather tab
- Promised weather-based recipe recommendations

**After:**
- Simplified to single view with all recipes
- Removed tab navigation
- Shows recipe filter and grid directly
- Updated description: "Discover our family's cherished recipes"

### 2. Homepage (`/`)
**Before:**
- Button text: "Browse Weather-Smart Recipes"
- Browse tab text: "Weather-based recipe recommendations coming soon!"

**After:**
- Button text: "Browse Recipes"
- Browse tab text: "Explore our collection of family recipes!"

### 3. README.md
**Before:**
- Listed "🌦️ Forecast-to-Feast: Dynamic weather-based recipe recommendations"
- Had dedicated section explaining the feature
- Detailed weather-based selection examples

**After:**
- Lists "📅 Meal Planning Calendar: Plan meals with weather-based suggestions"
- New section explaining calendar features
- Focus on planning rather than real-time recommendations

### 4. Removed Components
The following file is no longer used (but still exists in codebase):
- `src/components/forecast-to-feast-hero.tsx`

The following supporting files remain but are unused:
- `src/lib/meal-recommendations.ts`
- `scripts/test-weather-recommendations.ts`

## 🎯 New Direction

### The Forecast-to-Feast concept has been replaced by:

**Meal Planning Calendar** - A comprehensive meal planning system with:
- Calendar views (Month/Week/Day)
- Weather forecasts integrated into planning
- Meal organization by type
- Color-coded interface
- Shopping list generation

### Key Differences:

| Old Feature | New Feature |
|-------------|-------------|
| Real-time weather recommendations | Planned meals with weather context |
| Algorithm-driven suggestions | User-driven meal selection |
| Hero section on recipes page | Dedicated meal plan page |
| Immediate "what to cook now" | Future-oriented planning |
| Single-use recommendations | Reusable meal plans |

## 🗑️ Optional Cleanup

If you want to fully remove unused files, you can delete:

```bash
# Remove unused components
rm src/components/forecast-to-feast-hero.tsx

# Remove unused libraries (optional)
rm src/lib/meal-recommendations.ts

# Remove test scripts (optional)
rm scripts/test-weather-recommendations.ts
```

- **Build**: ✅ Successful
- **Bundle Size**: Reduced by ~27KB (recipes page: 30.9kB → 3.08kB)
