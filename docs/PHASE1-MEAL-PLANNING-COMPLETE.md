## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Database Schema Updates
Successfully updated Prisma schema with the following new models:

#### New Enums:
- `MealType`: BREAKFAST, LUNCH, DINNER, SNACK

#### New Models:
- **MealPlan**: Container for meal planning periods
  - Links to User
  - Has name, start/end dates
  - Can be active/inactive

  - Can use recipe OR custom meal name
  - Tracks completion status
  - Stores weather snapshot at planning time

- **ShoppingList**: Auto-generated shopping lists
  - Links to User and optionally MealPlan
  - Stores items as JSON with categories
  - Tracks checked/unchecked items

- **MealTemplate**: Reusable meal patterns
  - User-defined templates (e.g., "Typical Monday")
  - Stores meal configurations as JSON

- **WeatherCache**: Caches weather forecast data
  - Stores temperature, conditions, precipitation
  - Includes latitude/longitude for location
  - Auto-expires after 1 hour

### 2. API Routes Created

#### `/api/meal-plans`
- **GET**: List all meal plans for authenticated user
  - Optional `?active=true` filter

  - Returns 7-14 day forecast
  - Caches results for 1 hour

### 3. Services & Utilities

#### Weather Service (`/src/lib/weather-service.ts`)
- **OpenWeather API Integration**
  - Fetches 5-day/3-hour forecasts
  - Aggregates into daily forecasts
  - Converts Kelvin to Fahrenheit
- **Location Detection**
  - Auto-detects user location via IP geolocation
  - Falls back to NYC if detection fails
- **Caching System**
  - Stores forecasts in database
  - Reduces API calls
  - Auto-expires stale data
- **Mock Data Generator**
  - Fallback for development
  - Works without API key

### 4. Type Definitions

Added comprehensive TypeScript types in `/src/lib/types.ts`:
- `MealType`, `PlannedMeal`, `MealPlan`
- `ShoppingList`, `ShoppingListItem`
- `MealTemplate`
- `WeatherForecast`
- `MealPlanGenerationParams`

### 5. Environment Configuration

Updated `.env.local` with:
```bash
DATABASE_URL=<PostgreSQL connection string>
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key_here
```

## üìä Database Migration Status

- ‚úÖ Schema updated with `prisma db push`
- ‚úÖ Prisma Client regenerated
- ‚úÖ All new models available in production database

## üîß Configuration Requirements

### OpenWeather API Setup:
1. Sign up at https://openweathermap.org/api
2. Get free API key
3. Add to `.env.local`: `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_key_here`
4. Free tier includes:
   - 1,000 calls/day
   - 5-day/3-hour forecast
   - Current weather

### Database:
- Using PostgreSQL (Neon)
- Connection configured in `.env.local`
- Schema synced to production

## üéØ What's Next (Phase 2)

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. **Create React Components**
   - `<MealPlanningCalendar>` - Main calendar view
   - `<CalendarGrid>` - Month/Week/Day grid
   - `<MealSlot>` - Individual meal display
   - `<WeatherIntegration>` - Weather display

2. **State Management**
   - Set up React Query for data fetching
   - Create custom hooks (useMealPlan, useWeather)

3. **Calendar Views**
   - Month view with mini meal previews
   - Week view with detailed meal cards
   - Day view with full recipe details

4. **User Interactions**
   - Click to add meal
   - Drag and drop to reschedule
   - Quick edit modal

## üìù API Usage Examples

### Create a Meal Plan
```typescript
POST /api/meal-plans
{
  "name": "Summer Week 1",
  "startDate": "2025-10-06",
  "endDate": "2025-10-12",
  "isActive": true
}
```

### Add a Meal
```typescript
POST /api/meal-plans/{planId}/meals
{
  "date": "2025-10-06",
  "mealType": "DINNER",
  "recipeId": "recipe-id-here",
  "servings": 4,
  "notes": "Make extra for leftovers"
}
```

### Get Weather Forecast
```typescript
GET /api/weather/forecast?startDate=2025-10-06&endDate=2025-10-12
// Returns array of WeatherForecast objects
```

## üêõ Known Issues / Notes

1. **TypeScript Errors**: The new Prisma types are showing compile errors in VS Code. This is temporary and will resolve when the TypeScript server picks up the regenerated Prisma Client. Run `Developer: Reload Window` if needed.

2. **Weather API Limits**: Free tier OpenWeather is limited to 1,000 calls/day. The caching system helps reduce calls significantly.

3. **Migration History**: The project has SQLite migrations but is now using PostgreSQL. Future proper migrations should be created once development stabilizes.
