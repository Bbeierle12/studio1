## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Database Migration Required

Before deploying, you **MUST** run the Prisma migration:

```bash
# When DATABASE_URL is available
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_nutrition_tracking

# Regenerate Prisma Client
npx prisma generate
```

This creates:
- 8 new columns in the Recipe table
- New NutritionGoal table
- Indexes for performance

### Build and Deploy

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start production server (local test)
npm start

# Or deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

## 💡 Tips for Users

### Getting Started with Nutrition Tracking

1. **Start Simple**
   - Use preset goals (Weight Loss, Maintenance, or Muscle Gain)
   - Don't worry about entering nutrition for every recipe at first
   - Focus on your main meals

2. **Build Your Database**
   - Add nutrition to frequently used recipes first
   - Copy nutrition from food labels when available
   - Nutrition data is per serving (divide by servings if label shows total)

3. **Track Consistently**
   - Plan meals in advance for better tracking
   - Review daily summary at end of each day
   - Adjust goals based on progress

4. **Use the Insights**
   - Check macro distribution to ensure balanced diet
   - Monitor fiber and sodium in "Other Nutrients" section
   - Use weekly view to spot trends

## ❓ FAQ

### Do I need to add nutrition data to all recipes?

No! Nutrition data is completely optional. The NutritionBadge only shows if a recipe has nutrition data. Meals without nutrition data simply won't contribute to your daily totals.

### Can I have multiple nutrition goals?

Yes, but only one goal can be active at a time. You can create multiple goals (e.g., "Cutting", "Bulking", "Maintenance") and switch between them by editing and activating/deactivating.

### How do I get nutrition data for recipes?

Currently, you need to enter it manually. Future enhancements will include:
- Auto-estimation from ingredients
- Food database integration
- Recipe URL import

### Does the nutrition scale with servings?

Yes! When you add a meal to your plan and specify servings (e.g., 2 servings), the nutrition automatically scales. If a recipe is 350 calories per serving and you eat 2 servings, the daily summary will show 700 calories.

### Can I track micronutrients (vitamins, minerals)?

Not yet. Phase 4A focuses on macros (calories, protein, carbs, fat) plus fiber, sugar, and sodium. Micronutrient tracking is planned for a future phase.
