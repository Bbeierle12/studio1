1. Add `<NLPCommandInput />` to meal planning calendar header
2. Add `<SmartSuggestionsPanel />` to meal selection dialogs
3. Add `<AutoTagButton />` to recipe edit forms
4. Test all features with real OpenAI API calls

### User Onboarding
1. Guide users to add OpenAI API key in Settings
2. Show example NLP commands on first use
3. Highlight AI features in UI with sparkle icons
4. Add tooltips explaining confidence scores

### Testing
1. Manual testing with all example commands
2. Test with various weather conditions
3. Verify batch tagging with 10+ recipes
4. Test clarification flow in NLP
5. Validate learned preferences over time

---

## Usage Examples

### Smart Suggestions
```tsx
<SmartSuggestionsPanel
  date={new Date()}
  mealType="DINNER"
  weather={{ temperature: 45, condition: 'rainy' }}
  onSelectSuggestion={addToCalendar}
/>
```

### NLP Planning
```tsx
<NLPCommandInput
  placeholder="Try: 'Add pasta for Tuesday dinner'"
  onSuccess={() => refetchMealPlan()}
/>
```

### Auto-Tagging
```tsx
<AutoTagButton
  recipeId={recipe.id}
  onTagsGenerated={(result) => {
    updateRecipeTags(result.tags);
  }}
/>
```

## Performance Metrics

### Response Times (estimated)
- Smart suggestions: 2-4 seconds
- NLP parsing: 1-3 seconds
- Auto-tagging: 1-2 seconds per recipe
- Batch tagging: 5-10 seconds for 10 recipes

### Cost Estimates (OpenAI API)
- Suggestions: $0.01-0.03 per request
- NLP: $0.01-0.02 per command
- Auto-tag: $0.01 per recipe
- **Monthly**: $5-15 for typical usage

### Caching Strategy
- Suggestions cached 5 minutes
- Auto-tag results cached 10 minutes
- NLP commands not cached (always fresh)

---

## Known Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **OpenAI Dependency**: Requires user OpenAI API key
2. **English Only**: NLP parsing optimized for English
3. **Rate Limits**: 10-30 requests/minute per user
4. **Learning Window**: 30-day meal history for preference learning

### Future Enhancements
1. Voice commands via speech-to-text
2. Image recognition for food photos
3. Collaborative filtering from community
4. Multi-language NLP support
5. Offline AI with local models
