## üìú CCPA Compliance Requirements

### Consumer Rights Under CCPA

#### 1. **Right to Know** ‚úÖ
Users can request what personal data we collect.

**Implementation Needed:**
```typescript
// Create: src/app/api/user/data-export/route.ts
// Export all user data in JSON format
```

#### 2. **Right to Delete** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL
Users can delete their account, but we need a proper endpoint.

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ Cascade deletes configured in schema
- ‚ùå No user-facing "Delete My Account" button
- ‚ùå No data export before deletion

**Action Required:** Create account deletion endpoint

#### 3. **Right to Opt-Out of Sale** ‚úÖ N/A
We don't sell personal information.

#### 4. **Right to Non-Discrimination** ‚úÖ
Users aren't charged different prices or denied service for exercising rights.

#### 5. **Notice at Collection** ‚ö†Ô∏è MISSING
Must inform users what data we collect at signup.

**Action Required:** Add privacy notice at registration

---

## üá™üá∫ GDPR Considerations

Even though you're US-based, GDPR applies if you have EU users.

### GDPR Requirements

#### 1. **Lawful Basis** ‚úÖ
- **Consent**: User registration = consent
- **Contract**: Necessary for service
- **Legitimate Interest**: Security, fraud prevention

#### 2. **Data Minimization** ‚úÖ
We only collect what's necessary.

#### 3. **Right to Access** ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS WORK
Users should be able to download their data.

#### 4. **Right to Erasure** ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS WORK
"Right to be forgotten" - proper account deletion.

#### 5. **Data Portability** ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS WORK
Export data in machine-readable format (JSON).

#### 6. **Privacy by Design** ‚úÖ GOOD
- Passwords hashed
- API keys encrypted
- No unnecessary data collection

---

## üîí Security Measures (Current Status)

### ‚úÖ **What You're Doing Right:**

1. **Password Security**
   - ‚úÖ bcrypt hashing
   - ‚úÖ Salt rounds (10)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Weak password policy (min 8 chars)

2. **Authentication**
   - ‚úÖ NextAuth with session management
   - ‚úÖ CSRF protection
   - ‚úÖ Secure cookies

3. **Data Encryption**
   - ‚úÖ API keys encrypted (AES-256-GCM)
   - ‚úÖ HTTPS in production
   - ‚úÖ PostgreSQL SSL connections

4. **Access Control**
   - ‚úÖ Role-based access (USER, ADMIN)
   - ‚úÖ Row-level security via userId
   - ‚úÖ Authentication required for AI endpoints

5. **Input Validation**
   - ‚úÖ Zod schema validation
   - ‚úÖ SQL injection protected (Prisma ORM)
   - ‚úÖ XSS protection (React escaping)

6. **Rate Limiting** (NEW!)
   - ‚úÖ 20 requests/min for AI
   - ‚úÖ IP + User ID tracking
   - ‚úÖ Prevents abuse

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Vulnerabilities to Fix

### üî¥ CRITICAL

#### 1. **Exposed API Key in Code**
Your OpenAI key is now in `.env.local` which is good, but:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure it's never committed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Check Git history for exposed keys

**Action:**
```powershell
# Check if key was ever committed:
git log -p --all -S "sk-proj-" | Select-String "sk-proj"
```

#### 2. **No Account Deletion Flow**
Users can't delete their accounts - CCPA violation.

**Action Required:** Create deletion endpoint

### üü† HIGH PRIORITY

#### 3. **Weak Password Requirements**
Current: Min 8 characters (any)
Should: 12+ chars, complexity requirements

#### 4. **No Privacy Policy**
Legally required for CCPA/GDPR compliance.

#### 5. **No Terms of Service**
Protect yourself from liability.

#### 6. **No Cookie Consent Banner**
Required if you have EU visitors.
