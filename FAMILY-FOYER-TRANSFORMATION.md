# 🏡 Family Foyer Transformation

## Overview
Replaced the traditional "homepage" concept with a warm, welcoming **Family Foyer** - your recipe living room, not a sales page.

## What Changed

### 🎨 Visual & Messaging
- **Before**: "Homepage", "Dashboard", "Welcome back, Chef"
- **After**: "Family Foyer", "Living Room", "Welcome home, Friend"

### 🧭 Navigation
- Header link changed from **"Home"** to **"Foyer"**
- Reflects the welcoming, homey nature of the space

### 📱 Simple Hub Layout

The new foyer shows a clean, card-based hub with exactly what you requested:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│     Welcome home, [User Name]      │
│  Your family's recipe living room   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

┌───────────────┬───────────────┐
│ 📅 This       │ 🍳 New        │
│ Week's Meals  │ Recipes       │
├───────────────┼───────────────┤
│ 📝 Family     │ ➕ Add        │
│ Notes         │ Recipe        │
└───────────────┴───────────────┘

Quick access: ❤️ Favorites • 🍂 Seasonal

- No "dashboard" vibes

### ✅ The Living Room
- Warm, welcoming language ("Welcome home")
- Simple, clear choices
- Family-oriented messaging ("Family Notes", "Family's week")
- Personal touch (uses user's name)

## User Experience

1. **Personal greeting** - "Welcome home, [Name]"

3. **4 main actions** - In easy-to-scan cards
4. **Quick shortcuts** - For frequent tasks
5. **Warm footer** - "Where memories are made"

## Visual Design

- **Hover effects** - Scale and shadow for interactivity

- **Responsive** - Stacks on mobile, 2x2 grid on desktop
