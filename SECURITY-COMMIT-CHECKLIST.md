## 🔒 Security Measures Confirmed

| Measure | Status | Location |
|---------|--------|----------|
| `.env.local` in `.gitignore` | ✅ Confirmed | `.gitignore` line 39 |
| API key NOT in Git history | ✅ Verified | Checked with `git ls-files` |
| Rate limiting active | ✅ Implemented | `src/app/api/cooking-assistant/route.ts` |
| Authentication required | ✅ Active | All `/api` routes |
| Password hashing | ✅ Active | bcrypt in auth system |
| API key encryption | ✅ Active | AES-256-GCM for user keys |
| Input validation | ✅ Active | Zod schemas |

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Limitations

### Still Need to Implement:
1. **Privacy Policy Page** - Required for CCPA compliance
2. **Terms of Service Page** - Legal protection
3. **Account Deletion Endpoint** - CCPA "Right to Delete"
4. **Privacy Notice at Registration** - CCPA disclosure requirement
5. **Stronger Password Policy** - Currently min 8 chars (should be 12+)
6. **Cookie Consent Banner** - If you have EU users
7. **Security Headers** - CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.

### Current Workarounds:
- Data export implemented ✅
- Rate limiting prevents abuse ✅
- API key protected ✅
- Users can update their data in Settings ✅
