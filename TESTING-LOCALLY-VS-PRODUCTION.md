# üö® IMPORTANT: You're Testing on Production!

## The Real Issue

Your console error shows:
```
POST https://craicnkuche.com/api/cooking-assistant 422
```

This means you're using the **production website** (`https://craicnkuche.com`), not your **local development server** (`http://localhost:9002`).

## Why This Matters

1. **Your local changes aren't deployed** - The code improvements we made are only on your computer
2. **Your API key is only local** - The `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your `.env.local` is only available to your local dev server
3. **Production needs its own config** - The production server needs environment variables set in Vercel/deployment platform

## ‚úÖ Solution: Test Locally First

### Step 1: Start Your Local Dev Server

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Bbeie\Github\studio1
npm run dev
```

Wait for it to show:
```
‚ñ≤ Next.js 14.x.x
- Local:   http://localhost:9002
```

### Step 2: Open LOCALHOST in Your Browser

**Don't use:** `https://craicnkuche.com`  
**Use instead:** `http://localhost:9002`

### Step 3: Test the Voice Assistant

Now when you test the voice assistant:
- It will use your local code (with all the improvements)
- It will use your local `.env.local` file (with the working API key)
- Console errors will show much more detail
- It should work correctly!

## üöÄ After Testing Locally Successfully

Once it works on localhost, then you can deploy to production:

### 1. Set Production Environment Variables

In your deployment platform (Vercel, etc.):
- Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your API key
- Add all other required env vars from `.env.local`

### 2. Deploy Your Code

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Fix voice assistant OpenAI integration"
git push
```

### 3. Verify Production

After deployment completes, test on `https://craicnkuche.com`

## üìã Quick Checklist

- [ ] Local dev server is running (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Browser is open to `http://localhost:9002` (not production URL)
- [ ] Voice assistant is tested locally
- [ ] Works correctly on localhost
- [ ] Environment variables added to production
- [ ] Code pushed to repository
- [ ] Production deployment verified

## üîç How to Tell Which Server You're Using

**Look at the URL in your browser:**
- ‚úÖ `http://localhost:9002` ‚Üí Local dev server (use this for testing)
- ‚ùå `https://craicnkuche.com` ‚Üí Production server (deploy here after testing)

## üí° Pro Tip

Keep two browser tabs open:
1. **Tab 1:** `http://localhost:9002` - For testing changes
2. **Tab 2:** `https://craicnkuche.com` - To see production version

This way you won't confuse which one you're testing!

---

**TL;DR: Close the production site, start `npm run dev`, and open `http://localhost:9002` instead!**
