## 💡 Quick Wins to Try First

### 1. Show User Role in Header (15 min)

```tsx
// src/components/header.tsx
import { getRoleName, getRoleBadgeColor } from '@/lib/permissions';

<div className="flex items-center gap-2">
  <span>{user.name}</span>
  <span className={`px-2 py-1 rounded text-xs ${getRoleBadgeColor(user.householdRole)}`}>
    {getRoleName(user.householdRole)}
  </span>
</div>
```

### 2. Add Permission Check to Recipe Edit (10 min)

```tsx
// src/app/recipes/[id]/edit/page.tsx
import { canEditRecipe } from '@/lib/permissions';

if (!canEditRecipe(user, recipe)) {
  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>Permission Denied</CardTitle>
        <CardDescription>
          Only the recipe owner or household curators can edit this recipe.
        </CardDescription>
      </CardHeader>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

### 3. Create Simple Reaction Button (30 min)

```tsx
// src/components/recipe/quick-react.tsx
export function QuickReact({ recipeId }: { recipeId: string }) {
  const emojis = ['❤️', '😋', '🔥', '👍'];
  
  const react = async (emoji: string) => {
    await fetch(`/api/recipes/${recipeId}/reactions`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ emoji })
    });
  };
  
  return (
    <div className="flex gap-2">
      {emojis.map(emoji => (
        <button 
          key={emoji}
          onClick={() => react(emoji)}
          className="text-2xl hover:scale-125 transition-transform"
        >
          {emoji}
        </button>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

Your recipe app is now designed around these principles:

2. **Multi-Generational** - Works for kids AND grandparents  
3. **Low Effort** - Weekly digest is automatic
4. **High Touch** - Voice notes, stories, reactions
5. **Offline First** - Kitchen doesn't always have WiFi
6. **Print Friendly** - Some prefer paper recipes
