# 🎉 Recipe Hub - Phase 3 STARTED!

**Date Started**: October 9, 2025  
**Status**: 🚀 IN PROGRESS  
**First Feature**: Favorites API Integration

---

## ✅ What's Been Completed

### 🗄️ Database Schema (DONE)
Added `FavoriteRecipe` model to track user favorites:

```prisma
model FavoriteRecipe {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId    String
  user      User     @relation("UserFavorites", fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  recipeId  String
  recipe    Recipe   @relation("RecipeFavorites", fields: [recipeId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())

  @@unique([userId, recipeId])
  @@index([userId])
  @@index([recipeId])
}
```

**Files Modified**:
- ✅ `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added FavoriteRecipe model
- ✅ `prisma/schema.prisma` - Updated User model with favorites relation
- ✅ `prisma/schema.prisma` - Updated Recipe model with favorites relation

**Migration Files Created**:
- ✅ `prisma/migrations/manual_add_favorite_recipes.sql` - Manual migration SQL

---

### 🔌 API Endpoints (DONE)
Created two new API routes for favorites functionality:

#### 1. GET `/api/recipes/favorites`
- Fetches all favorited recipes for authenticated user
- Returns array of Recipe objects
- Requires authentication
- Orders by most recently favorited

**File**: `src/app/api/recipes/favorites/route.ts`

#### 2. POST `/api/recipes/[id]/favorite`
- Toggles favorite status for a recipe
- Returns `{ favorited: boolean }`
- Requires authentication
- Handles both adding and removing favorites

**File**: `src/app/api/recipes/[id]/favorite/route.ts`

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

### 1. Deploy & Migrate Database
The database schema has been updated, but needs to be migrated in production:

**Option A: Automated (Recommended)**
```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

**Option B: Manual**
Run the SQL in: `prisma/migrations/manual_add_favorite_recipes.sql`

### 2. Regenerate Prisma Client
After migration, regenerate the Prisma client:
```bash
npx prisma generate
```

### 3. Test the API
Once deployed:
- [ ] Test adding favorites
- [ ] Test removing favorites
- [ ] Test fetching favorites
- [ ] Verify authentication requirements
- [ ] Check error handling

### 4. Frontend Verification
The frontend is already set up and should work automatically:
- ✅ `src/lib/recipe-api.ts` - API client functions exist
- ✅ `src/components/recipes/recipe-detail-drawer.tsx` - UI already integrated
- ✅ `src/components/recipes/my-recipes.tsx` - Favorites tab exists

Just need to test that it all works together!

## 📝 Developer Notes

### Known Issues
1. **Prisma Generate Error**: Permission issue when running `npx prisma generate` locally
   - **Solution**: Will regenerate on deployment or restart VS Code/terminal
   - **Not Blocking**: API code is complete

2. **Type Errors in API Routes**: `favoriteRecipe` not recognized by TypeScript
   - **Cause**: Prisma client not regenerated yet
   - **Solution**: Will resolve after `npx prisma generate` runs successfully
   - **Not Blocking**: Code is correct, just needs types

### Architecture Decisions
- **Separate FavoriteRecipe table**: Better than boolean on Recipe (allows querying, timestamps, etc.)
- **Unique constraint**: Prevents duplicate favorites
- **Cascade deletes**: Cleanup when user or recipe deleted
- **Indexed fields**: Fast queries for user's favorites

### Testing Checklist
When deployed:
- [ ] Can favorite a recipe (heart icon fills)
- [ ] Can unfavorite a recipe (heart icon outlines)
- [ ] Favorites persist on page reload
- [ ] Favorites tab shows correct recipes
- [ ] Optimistic updates work (instant feedback)
- [ ] Error messages show if API fails
- [ ] Can't favorite without authentication
- [ ] Favorites update across tabs/components
